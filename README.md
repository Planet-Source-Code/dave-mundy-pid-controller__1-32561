### Description

Demonstrates how to implement a closed loop PID Controller. A PID controller is a closed loop control system (for real world applications) that is used to control systems that include feedback.

some examples that may include a PID loop:

temperature control (such as a thermostat)

position control (such as a servo)

speed control

Includes a class that allows easy implementation in other applications.

The *.frx files are now included
